          Welcome to your first lesson! Today we'll learn about Uniswap, one of the most popular
          decentralized exchanges in the DeFi ecosystem.
    
          Uniswap is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows users to trade tokens without
          the need for a traditional order book. Instead, it uses liquidity pools and a mathematical
          formula to determine prices.
